# Myles Mitera ETL Challenge

Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my submission as well as giving me an opportunity to 
demonstrate my skills.

The executable is named Main.py, it can be run locally to generate the desired reports.

To run deployment, download the repository, cd into the folder of the project and run 
docker run -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports mentat31/mmiteraetlproj:final

This command will run the docker container and write the files to the reports directory within the project.
I've included the files in this upload to demonstrate the successful code, however if removed you will the 
directory repopulate upon running the container.
